To generate the html doc from the .rst files, run `make html`. You need the
Sphinx documentation generator to do that.
A generated doc is available at <http://supybot.fr.cr/doc/>.

The .rst files in use/plugins/ has been generate *once* by
`generate_plugin_doc.py` and `append_config_doc.py` (I may have modified them
temporaly to match my file hierarchy).
All of them has been reviewed *and* modified by hand: include unofficial.inc
if needed, and the second-level titles, sort commands by type, ... Don't
even think about running that scripts again on a generated doc, it would
overwrite it.

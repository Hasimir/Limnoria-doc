The Trigger plugin
==================

.. include:: unofficial.inc

This plugin allows you to run commands triggered by an event.

If you want, for example, trigger a kick when a user join without giving
him the :ref:`op capability <capability-op>`, you need the `Sudo plugin
<plugin-sudo>`.

`plugin-conditional` may also be useful here.

The MegaHAL plugin
==================

Provides an interface to the MegaHAL chatterbot.

.. WARNING::

    This plugin is **highly** deprecated and unstable.

    It may cause your bot to randomly uppercase some letters, and you'll
    have to restart it to make it stop (temporaly).
    This is particulary annoying, and you won't be able to identify,
    because it uppercases letters in your password.
    More over, only this bug has been noticed, but it may cause security
    issues with your bot.

    You shouldn't use it at all.
